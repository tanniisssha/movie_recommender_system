A Movie Recommender System is a tool that suggests movies to users based on their preferences, viewing history, or similarities to other users.
It typically uses one of two approaches: collaborative filtering, which recommends movies based on the preferences of similar users, or content-based filtering, which suggests movies similar to those the user has already watched based on features like genre, actors, and directors.
Some systems also combine both approaches (hybrid methods) to improve recommendation accuracy.
